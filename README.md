# Midterm-Project-loan-approval-analysis

### Created by: Yuchen He, Ethan Lam, Cynthia Okaja

## Project/Goals
To develop a model that will predict the likelihood of loan approval based on customer details such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history and others.

## Process
### Data collection from Kaggle
### Data Preprocessing
### EDA process for data visualization 
### Data visualization using tableau
#### Approval Rate Dashboard

#### Approval Amount Dashboard

### Hypothesis testing
### Modelling

## Results
- Produced two models with 86% and 77% accuracy of predicting loan approval status
- Loan term, cibil score have major effects on the approval

## Challenges 
- Trying to optimize models 
    - Selecting the “perfect” combination of features
- Using advanced features of Tableau
    - Forecasting: not available since the dataset does not contain temporal data
    - Casting data to correct data types

## Future Goals
- Stretch: determining whether the loan can be paid back in time
- Getting a more detailed dataset
